# Prince
Mini Arena RPG for Pico-8
by John Adam Ziolkowski

Battle enemies, form a team, steal elements, and make it to the final boss!
This game is made with minimalism at its core.
A lot of effort was taken to pare the idea back to a simple experience.
Note: This is not a game of skill, but a game of chance.

# Tips:
- No HP, everything goes down in one hit (try to take the best chances)
- The beginning is pure luck, but as you progress your choices matter more
- More team members join later
- Fighter hits 2x more often
- Caster can target 3 enemies
- Prince steals elements from enemies
- L: View element chart in battle
- R: Change settings in battle (draw stats to see hit chances)
- Can change party at campfire (on level up or set back)
- Don't give up! Being set back gives you a chance to take more elements!
- Final fight is at level 16.
- You can do this! Good luck!!!
